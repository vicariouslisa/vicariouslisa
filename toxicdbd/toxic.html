   <h3 class="red">1. Basic gameplay.</h3>
    <p class="white"> 
    <span class="word">Dead by daylight</span> is a 4v1 online multiplayer game which is great to play both for fun with friends and in a more serious manner. <br>
    The ojbective of Dead by daylight is rather simple. Fix 5 out of 7 generators to power up the exit gates and get out while the killer hunts you down. <br>
    There are multiple types of killers in the game which keeps the gameplay from going stale, currently there are 12 killers in the game with the next <br>
     one available on the <span class="word">PTB</span>. There are also perks that both killers and survivors can equip depending on your playstyle. <br>
    To fix a generator all you need to do is go up to it and hold Mouse button 1, unless you bind it to something else, and it will start repairing, as you <br>
    repair the generator you will get random skill checks. A minor sound idicator will warn you of an incoming skillcheck, to do the skill check you simply <br>
    press your spacebar at the right time to land it, there are two types of skill checks you can land, a "skill check" and a "great skill check", the great <br>
    skillcheck is a bit harder to land so I wouldn´t recommend trying to hit it while you are still getting used to the game as when you fail a skill check <br>
    the killer will be notified of your location. You also get skill checks preforming other actions i.e. healing yourself or others. <br>
    How the killer wins is to kill all 4 survivors but hooking them up to 3 times on meathooks scattered around the map. <br>
    How many time you can be hooked depends on how fast you get saved as there are 3 phases on the hook. In the first phase you simple hang there and have to <br>
    wait on your pals to save you, well you do get the chance to "attempt escape" but there is only a 4% chance of you making it of the hook that way and <br>
    you enter phase 2 a lot quicker. In phase to you need to struggle against the Entity which is a creature the killers are trying to sacrifice you to. <br>
    The third and final stage is your death, when you hit this stage thats it! You are out of the match! <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h3 class="red">2. Terror radius.</h3>
    <p class="white">Almost all killers have what is called a <span class="word">terror radius</span>, this radius is for you to know if the killer is near, the most common terror radius is a simple <br>
    heartbeat that you will start to hear when they are about 40 meters away from you, the louder and faster the heartbeat is the close the killer. <br>
    Some killers do not have the heartbeat radius but a song instead, for example The nightmare has a terror radius of little girls singing and The <br>
    Huntress has a russian lullaby that she hums. Some killers have less of a terror radius, some more and then a few, like the wraith, has none while <br>
    his power is active. <br> </p>
    <br>

    <h3 class="red"> 3. Escaping the killer.</h3>
    <p class="white">Now, if the killer finds you what do you do? <br>
    Well first and foremost you run BUT while you run at a <span class="word">100%</span> movement speed the main killer running speed <br>
    is a <span class="word">110%</span>, as in the killer runs faster then you! So if you just run in a straight line the killer will get to you pretty quickly <br>
    Well then how the hell do you get away? <br>
    You have to outplay them using clusters of walls and buildings with windows to jump through and pallets to drop on the killers face which stuns <br>
    them for a moment until either they lose you or get tired of chasing you.<br> </p>
</span>
    <h3 class="red">4. Perks, items and offerings.</h3>
     <p class="white"> <span class="word">The bloodweb</span> is what is used as a leveling system in DBD, when in a match you gain points for every action you make in the game called bloodpoints which <br>
    are what you use to unlock things like perks, items and offering in the bloodweb. Up until level 10 you will be able to get everything in your bloodweb <br>
    page but after that you will have to start looking at what you are getting from the web. Some items and offerings are rarer then <br>
    others and will cost you more bloodpoints to unlock. <br>
    The most useful items in the game would be the toolkit, medkit and flashlight. The toolkits can be used to repair generators faster, <br>
     medkits will allow you to heal yourself as it is not possible to do so without the kit or a perk called "Self care".<br>
     The flashlights can be used to blind the killer, this can be used to your own benefit while being chased and it can also be used to <br>
    save other survivors when the killer picks them up, causing the killer to drop them and them running away but using the flashlight can be a bit tricky. <br>
    Offerings are things you can use only once and only one for each trial but some are stackable so if your teammate uses one aswell they will stack. <br>
    Some offerings will offer you a percentage on extra bloodpoint gain in the match, some will make the map darker or foggier and some will make it <br>
    liklier for you to get a certain map. <br>
    The bloodweb is also where you unlock perks for your survivor, these are very important as the make your life a hell of a lot easier. <br>
    There are 53 perks in the game which is great for making the perfect perk build for your playstyle. You can have 4 perks in each game, now these <br>
    do not disappear after the match is over, perks are available to you for ever after unlocking unless you decide to prestige your survivor, when <br>
    you prestige you lose all progress on your survivor but you will start seeing rarer itms and better perks in your bloodweb after you do so and <br>
    some new clothing to flex your level to other survivors, you can prestige 3 times when your survivor hits level 50. <br>
    Now, every survivor has 3 perks that are called teachables, each teachable perk is secluded to that survivor until you reach levels 30, 35 and <br>
    40 on that survivor, after that you can find it in the bloodwebs of all of your survivors. <br>
    Now for the most used and best perks in the current stand of the game. <br> </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Selfcare </li>
        <li>Sprint burst </li>
        <li>Borrowed time </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="white"> <span class="word">"Self care"</span> which is a Claudette Morel perk which you can unlock by
    leveling her to level 40, this perk is the only way to heal yourself without a medkit or <br>
     having others to do it, hence its popularity. <br>
    <span class="word">"Sprint burst"</span> which is a Meg Thomas perk that can unlocked by leveling her to level 35, this <br>
    allows you to sprint at a 150% running speed for 3 seconds which might not sound like much but can be very precious when the killer pops <br>
    up behind you from nowhere, this perk though does give you a debuff called "Exhaustion" which will go away after 60 seconds of walking or <br>
    staying still. While exhausted "Sprint burst" will not activate. <br>
    <span class="word">"Borrowed time"</span> is a great perk to counter those pesky killers that like to camp people on the hook. Borrowed time is a Bill Overbeck perk <br>
    that makes it so that if you unhook a survivor while in the terror radius of the killer if they get hit within 15 seconds of being unhooked <br>
    they will not go into the dying state BUT if they do get hit a timer will start, at the end of that time of 25 seconds the survivor will get <br>
    downed into the dying state unless they are healed before the timer runs out. They will also get downed again if they get hit a second time. <br>
    These are the perks that I personally find the most useful and are considered the strongest at this moment in time. <br>
    <br>
    I do though recommend that you go over all of the survivor unlockables in game to make sure that you are starting out with the character <br>
    that is right for you.</p>

    <h3 class="red">5.Toxic </h3>
 <p class="white"> Now, for the best part! How to be toxic! <br>
    Now you might be asking yourself, why be toxic? Well what I have to say to that is why the hell not? <br>
    I personally tend not to be toxic unless the killer is being toxic, toxic killers include killers that tunnel, camp or mock.<br>
    There are plenty of things you can utilize to be toxic, including perks, the map and items. <br>
    Some maps have things called "infinity loops"  The first infinity loops that come to mind are the pig tree in the coldwind farm realm, <br>
    the main building on the Macmillan estate; groaning store house and ironworks of misery and the two broken down busses on autohaven, <br>
    if you are good enough you can loop the killer in these infinity loops while your team mates do all 5 generators, unless of course <br>
    the killer gets bored of you and starts looking for your fellow surivors.<br>
    The killer shack can be used to loop the killer for a good while though it is not counted as an infinity loop, the pallet in the killer <br>
    shack is refered to as the god pallet and should only be used is when absoulutely necessary. <br>
    Now looping is not necessarily counted as "toxic" as I mean, you need to do what ever you can do get away from the killer when they start <br>
    chasing you BUT if you get to an infinity loop and you add a flashlight to the combination is where it can start getting toxic, blind the <br>
    killer when he decides to go for breaking a pallet and use that couple of added seconds to add more space between you, killers HATE flashlights <br>
    and if you ever play killer you will understand why. <br>
   The flashlight is probably the most toxic item in the game, infact it can get killers to disconnect from the game.<br> </p>
   <p class="link">Source: <a href="https://plays.tv/video/5b87381d3f41af1753/gaius-discovers-the-flashlight?from=user" target="_blank"> Example. </a></p>
   <p class="white">With a perk like bond the flashlight can also be utilized to blind the killer as he picks up survivors causing him to drop them, with bond you can <br>
   see other survivors auras withing a certain range so when you see the killer is chasing someone you run around the map until you can find the chased <br>
   survivor and get that blind ready to go for when they manage to down your fellow survivor. The toxic part of this is to be actively searching for them <br>
   and flashlighting every time the killer goes to pick someone up. <br>
   Another great perk for being toxic is decisive strike. This perk is also universally hated by killers, the perk works so that after the killer picks you <br>
   up you get a semi difficult skill check, if you land it you will stab the killer, he will drop you and get momentarily stunned so you can go and continue <br>
   on with your looping. <br>
   Now if a killer is being an ass and you want to loop them you can do things like sprinting in and out of closets and sprinting through windows to alert the <br>
   killer of your location (the notification they get is also super annoying when being spammed) to get them to come to you and chase you and if you feel extra <br>
   spicy you can use a perk called "Object of obsession" wich allows you to see the killers aura when they are a certain distance away and when you look at them <br>
   they see you too, some killers take it as a challenge and come right for you while others will say "fuck you" and leave you alone as they usually know that <br>
   people running the perk are good loopers. <br>
   Lithe is a good alternative to sprint burst when you intend to loop as it gives you a sprint burst after jumping through a window or over a pallet but is does <br>
   give you the exhausted debuff just like sprint burst.<br>
